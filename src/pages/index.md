  description: >
    In the software engineering field, if you stop learning, the field may pass
    you by. With the explosion in programming languages & libraries recently,
    this blog will document my attempts to keep up.

  This blog will primarily concentrate web development, focusing on programming
  in JavaScript and the many libraries & frameworks available to use with it. I
  will also discuss other programming languages and development tools that I
  have learned about.
