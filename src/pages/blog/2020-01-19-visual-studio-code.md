After trying several code editors & IDEs, I settled on Visual Studio Code for the one I use regularly for JavaScript Development. Here is a list of my top reasons for chosing it:

* Lightweight base install
* Highly configurable
* Large extension ecosystem to add features
* Supports multiple programming languages
* Git integration

After having used it for over a year, I don't know how I worked without it. The git integration is the biggest bonus for mes, as I can manage all my commits & pushes from inside the editor.
