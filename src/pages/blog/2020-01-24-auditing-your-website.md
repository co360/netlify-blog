Every website project I have worked on my primary focus was getting the correct information to display the way I wanted. There are a lot of other things to consider and I use auditing tools to check them. The auditing tool I use the most is Google Lighthouse. It can be run from the Chrome developer tools or by using the extension. It runs checks to rate the performance, accessibility, compliance with best practices, search engine optimization, and compliance with progressive web app standards. It can run the tests for desktop or mobile with simulated network slowdowns. The reports provided by this tool provide a good look at things you may want to change to make your site work the best for all potential visitors.
