Do you use any open source code? If you use any major JavaScript framework or Linux, the answer is definitely yes. I have been wanting to contribute for a while, to give back to projects I use and add projects to my resume. But trying to figure out where to start seemed daunting. GitHub recently announced new features to help potential contributors find good first issues to start with. Go to the GitHub repo of a project you like and add `/contribute` to the URL. This will bring you to a list of issues marked as good for first time contributors. 

For more information on all the new ways to find issues for first timers, check out this
