Finding a place to host your personal or test projects for free can be difficult. Here are a few that I use for hosting different things.

#### [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
Great place for testing out CSS and simple JavaScript.

#### [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
Host your static site right from your GitHub repo.

#### [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
Free hosting for Node.js projects, but will sleep after 30 minutes.

#### [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
Free tier for hosting many languages (Node.js, Python, Java), but free dynos also go to sleep. Offers paid add-ons and upgrade to always on responsiveness.
