React & Vue are two of the most popular JavaScript libraries for 
front-end web development. They both use a virtual DOM to control 
the content that will be displayed on a page. But this can make 
debugging difficult, as you can't easily see the data being passed to 
virtual elements. In order to make things easier for developers, the teams 
behind both libraries have created add-ons for Firefox & Chrome to allow you 
to see the virtual DOM element corresponding to the HTML element displayed. 
The React add-on for Firefox is shown in the image above.
