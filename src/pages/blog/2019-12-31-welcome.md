While working to keep my software engineering skills current, 
I have been developing sample projects and watching tutorials. 
While I have learned many things this way, 
I have realized that I have not been developing the skills to explain 
what I have learned to others.
So in order to work on my explantory skills,
I decided to start blogging about the software engineering skills I am learning.
<br><br>
My goal is to post something every day in January. 
After that, I hope to post 3+ times a week for the rest of the year.
