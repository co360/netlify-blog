Hooks were added to React in version 16.8. 
The purpose behind hooks was to create a way to allow you to reuse stateful logic 
between components without redesigning your application. 
In doing this, they created a way to allow developers to use many of the features 
previously only available in class components. 
This includes state variables & lifecycle methods. 
Over the next several posts I will cover 3 of the built-in hooks I used 
in a recent project.
